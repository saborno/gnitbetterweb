### **GNIT College Website - A Modern Redesign**

This repository contains a complete redesign of the official website for the **Guru Nanak Institute of Technology (GNIT)**. This project was undertaken to reimagine the college's digital presence, focusing on creating a modern, intuitive, and fully responsive user experience for students, faculty, and prospective applicants.

The primary goal was to move away from a traditional, static layout and build a dynamic and visually engaging platform. The redesign prioritizes clean aesthetics, streamlined navigation, and faster performance to ensure that essential information is both easy to find and pleasant to consume. By implementing a mobile-first design philosophy, the site is now perfectly accessible across all devices, from desktop monitors to smartphones.
